# Exportable Structures

This mod exists for the cases when a custom launcher breaks the structure blocks in Minecraft.

This mod adds a button **Export** in the **Save** mode of the structure block screen that lets you chose a folder where to export the structure.

I may add a feature to import `.nbt` structures in the future.
