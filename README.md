This mod exists for the cases when a custom launcher breaks the structure blocks in Minecraft.

This mod adds a button **Export** in the **Save** mode of the structure block screen that lets you chose a folder where to export the structure.

## Version 1.1_1.20.6

Exportable Structures now allows `.nbt` files to be imported from anywhere in your computer. To make this happen a few elements where moved in the **Load** screen of the structure block. Now to apply the rotation to the structure there is a state button that changes between `0`, `90`, `180` and `270`, replacing the respective buttons from Vanilla.
